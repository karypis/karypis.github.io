## Welcome

I'm a Professor at the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the University
of Minnesota in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul.

## Research

My research interests are concentrated in the areas of data mining, recommender
systems, learning analytics, high-performance computing, and chemical informatics and
from time-to-time, I look at various problems in the areas of health informatics,
information retrieval, bioinformatics, and scientific computing. 

Within these areas, my research focuses in developing novel algorithms for solving
important existing and/or emerging problems, and on developing practical software
tools implementing some of these algorithms. The results from this research have been
presented in various conferences and published in leading peer reviewed journals and
highly selective conference proceedings.

In my research I strive to develop algorithms that are practical (they can be easily
implemented on commercially available platforms), efficient (require as little time
as possible), effective (do a good job in solving the underlying problem), and
scalable (remain efficient and effective as we increase the size of the problem
and/or the number of processors). Quite often I consider my research as that of
algorithm engineering.

### Software

The research of my group research has resulted in the development of software
libraries for serial and parallel graph partitioning (METIS and ParMETIS), hypergraph
partitioning (hMETIS), for parallel Cholesky factorization (PSPASES), for
collaborative filtering-based recommendation algorithms (SUGGEST), clustering high
dimensional datasets (CLUTO), and finding frequent patterns in diverse datasets
(PAFI). In addition, my group has developed two web-based servers for clustering gene
expression data (gCLUTO) and for predicting the secondary structure of proteins
(YASSPP).

A lot of this software is available in the [Karypis
Lab](https://github.com/KarypisLab) github page. Additional information about the software and download instructions can be found
[here](glaros/software/overview.md).


### Publications

I have coauthored over one hundred journal and conference papers on these topics.

### Projects

Over the years I have developed many algorithms for a variety of problems including
dynamic load balancing of unstructured parallel computations, graph and circuit
partitioning, protein remote homology prediction and fold recognition, protein
structure prediction, recommender systems, data clustering, document classification
and clustering, frequent pattern discovery in diverse datasets (transactions,
sequences, graphs), parallel Cholesky factorization, and parallel preconditioners.

## Education, Mentoring, and Advising

I take great joy in teaching, advising, and mentoring undergraduate and graduate
students and I consider it to be one of the perks of my job.

My greatest pleasure and ultimate job satisfaction comes at those points during a
course at which my students transition from simply listening and reading the material
to actually understanding them, grasping them, internalizing them, and seeing how
they fit within the general computer science discipline and how they are applied to
solve real problems in real applications.

### Teaching

My regular teaching responsibilities include the introductory course on algorithms
and data structures (CSci 4041), a course on parallel computing (CSci 5451), a course
on data mining (CSci 5523), and a course describing various computational techniques
used in bioinformatics (CSci 5481).


### Advising 

Over the years I had the opportunity to advise and mentor many Ph.D. and M.S.
students. I find this to be a very rewarding experience and I have learned (and still
learning) a lot from all of my former and current students.

I believe that effective advisor-advisee relationships must be built on mutual trust,
commitment, and benefit, and be designed to advance the advisees education and
provide them with a solid foundation upon which to build their future career.

Pursing an advanced graduate degree and contacting research to advance the
state-of-the-art is not an easy task. Its outcome is never guaranteed, there are
always unforeseen complications, and not every idea works out! It requires
commitment, dedication, hard work, and the ability to know when to continue pursuing
a good idea even when the initial results are not very encouraging and when to stop
pursing a bad idea and start over again. I do not expect my students to be expert
researchers when joining my group, but I expect them to be bright, dedicated,
motivated, and willing to work as hard as I do.
