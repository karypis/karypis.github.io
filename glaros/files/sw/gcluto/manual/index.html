explore what features and user interface designs would work best
for a clustering application.
</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<hr border=0 color="#000000">
<a name="2"><h2>2 Installing gCLUTO</h2></a>

<p>
Currently, gCLUTO is available for both Linux and Microsoft Windows platforms.
To install gCLUTO:
</p>

<ul>
   <li>Find the latest version of gCLUTO at 
<a href="http://www.cs.umn.edu/~mrasmus/gcluto/">http://www.cs.umn.edu/~cluto/gcluto</a>.  

   <li>Download and unzip the archive to any location on your computer.
   <li>Read the <i>README.txt</i> file to locate the correct version of gCLUTO
       for your Operating System.
   <li>Windows users can make a desktop shortcut to <i>gcluto.exe</i> by
       locating gcluto.exe in the file manager, right-clicking the icon,
       dragging it to the desktop, and choosing "Create Shortcut Here" from the
       pop-up menu.
   <li>Linux users can create a symbolic link to the gcluto binary 
       ("ln -s gcluto wherever/you/want/the/link").  Place the
       symbolic link wherever is most convenient (ex: ~/bin).
</ul>

<i>Note: the actual executables (gcluto, gcluto.exe) must stay within their
folders in order to work propperly.  Do not relocate them.</i>

<a name="3"><h2>3 Using gCLUTO</h2></a>

<a name="3.1"><h2>3.1 Overview</h2></a>

<div width="320" style="float: right; padding: 5px" align="center">
<a href="images/screenshot1.jpg"><img alt="screen shot" src="images/screenshot1.jpg" 
   width="320"><br>Figure 3.1 - screen shot of gCLUTO</a>
<br><br>
</div>

<p>
When clustering data, many pieces of information are involved, such as data 
files, clustering solution files, and visualizations.  Like many other
applications, gCLUTO uses the concept of a <b>project</b> to organize the 
user's data and work flow.  When a project has been loaded, its contents will be
displayed in the tree view located at (a) in Figure 3.1.
</p>

<p>
Each item in the project is presented as an icon in the tree.
<ul>
   <li><img src="images/icon-project.png" width="15" height="15"> <b>Project</b> - This represents the 
   project itself.  It is the root of the project tree.
   <br><br>
   
   <li><img src="images/icon-data.png" width="15" height="15"> <b>Data</b> - After importing data into
   a project, one of these icons will appear in the project tree.  
   A project can contain many different data items.
   <br><br>
   
   <li><img src="images/icon-solution.png" width="15" height="15"> <b>Solution</b> - After clustering
   one of the data items, a solution item will be created and placed underneath
   the data item from which it was clustered.  
   <br><br>
   
   <li><img src="images/icon-matrix.png" width="15" height="15"> <b>Matrix Visualization</b> - This is 
   a visualization that can be generated after clustering.  All
   visualizations appear under the solutions they were generated from.
   <br><br>
   
   <li><img src="images/icon-mountain.png" width="15" height="15"> <b>Mountain Visualization</b> - This
   is another visualization that attempts to describe the inter-relationships 
   of clusters in a 3D way.
   <br><br>
</ul>

<b>Right clicking</b> on any item will
bring up a pop-up menu listing the available operations that can be preformed 
on the item.  <b>Double clicking</b> on any item will open its contents in a 
new window called a <b>view</b>, similar to the windows (b), (c), and (d)
in Figure 3.1.  While working in one of these views, extra menu options 
specific to the view's content will apear in the menu bar.
</p>



<a name="3.2"><h2>3.2 Creating a New Project</h2></a>

<p>
When gCLUTO first opens it starts with an empty project tree.  To begin work, a 
new project must be created.  To create a new project, go to the menu bar
and choose "File" and then "New Project".  A file dialog window will appear. 
Specify a name for your project and a location on your computer to save it.
</p>

<p>
gCLUTO will create a directory, called the <b>project directory</b>.
The Project Directory will be named 
after the project and stored at the specified location.  Within the project 
directory, gCLUTO will save all the information related to the project.
</p>

<p>
To open an existing project, choose the "File" menu and then 
"Open Project".  A file dialog will appear.  Navigate to the location of the
project directory and open it.  Within the project directory there will be a
file named "<i>project_name</i>.prj", where <i>project_name</i> will be the name
of the project.  Choose this file and click "Open".
</p>

<p>
After these steps, a project will be loaded and displayed in the project tree.
</p>

<p>
<i>
Note: gCLUTO 1.0 uses a different project directory structure than
gCLUTO 0.5.  Projects created using gCLUTO 0.5 can not be opened in
gCLUTO 1.0 and vice versa.
</i>
</p>

<a name="3.3"><h2>3.3 Importing Data</h2></a>

<p>
As of gCLUTO 1.0, gCLUTO accepts three file formats: CLUTO matrix files
(*.mat), CLUTO graph files (*.graph), and dense matrix delimited files.
For details on the exact formats of CLUTO matrix and graph files see
CLUTO's documentation.
</p>

<p>
The following file types are used when importing data in CLUTO file
formats:
</p>

<ul>
   <li><b>matrix file (*.mat)</b> - contains a dense matrix, sparse matrix, or
      similarity graph representing the data to be clustered.
   <li><b>row lables (*.rlabel)</b> - contains labels for the rows of the data 
      matrix.
   <li><b>column labels (*.clabel)</b> - contains labels for the columns of the
      data matrix.
   <li><b>class labels (*.rclass)</b> - contains class labels for the rows of the
     data matrix.
</ul>

<p>
Delimited files can be created by hand or exported by most spread sheet
programs.  gCLUTO can accept tab, space, semicolon, and comma delimited
files.  Other characters can also be specified as delimiters.
</p>

<p>
To import a new data item go to the menu bar and choose "Project" and then 
"Import Data".  The <b>Import Data</b> dialog will appear allowing the user to 
specify the location of a file for each of the file types listed above.  
Clicking on a "Browse" button will bring up a file dialog to allow the user to 
locate the needed files.  Only the *.mat file is required.  The user must also 
specify whether the *.mat file contains matrix data or graph data by selecting 
the appropriate option.
</p>

<p>
If the *.mat file is chosen first, gCLUTO will try to guess the location of
the optional files (*.rlabel, *.clabel, *.rclass) by appending the extension
onto the *.mat filename.  For example, for a file named <i>genes.mat</i>,
gCLUTO will guess <i>genes.mat.rlabel</i> for a row label file.  If such a file exists,
gCLUTO will make it the default file to open in the "Browse" file dialog.
</p>

<p>
If the user chooses to import a delimited file, the delimited file
options will become enabled.  gCLUTO can optionally interpret the first
row in the delimited file as column labels.  In addition, gCLUTO can
optionally interpret the first column as row labels.  User may also
specify which characters should be used as delimiters.  If multiple
characters are specified, then the occurrence of any one of them will
cause a field delimitation.  Blank fields are allowed in delimited
files.  If a blank occurs where a number is expected, then it will be
interpreted as a zero.  If a blank occurs where a label is expected,
then a default label of "no-label" will be used.
</p>

<p>
After specifying these files, the user may give a label for the data item.  
If no label is given, the data item will be labeled after its *.mat
file with the extension removed.  After clicking "OK" in the Import Data
dialog, gCLUTO will attempt to read in the chosen files.  If no errors are
encountered, gCLUTO will add the new data item to the project tree and open a 
<b>Data View</b>.  The Data View allows the user to view the data and verify
that it has been loaded correctly.
</p>


<a name="3.4"><h2>3.4 Clustering Data</h2></a>

<p>
If data has been imported using the steps given in <a href="#3.3">3.3</a> then
it is ready to be clustered.  Clustering can be initiated two
different ways.  The first is choosing "Cluster" from the pop-up menu that 
appears when you right-click on a data item in the project tree.  Secondly, the 
very same menu can be found in the menu bar under "Data" if a Data View is open.
</p>

<p>
After choosing "Cluster" in either menu a <b>Clustering Options</b> dialog will
appear with all the options available for clustering.  These options work 
exactly the same as in CLUTO.  For an explanation of their meanings see CLUTO's 
documentation.  Only particular options make sense together.  To help make
sensible choices, gCLUTO will autmatically update the dialog as the user makes 
choices to ensure that only reasonable choices are available.
</p>

<p>
Once the clustering options are chosen, click "Cluster" in the Clustering
Options dialog.  After gCLUTO finishes the clustering calculations it will 
respond by creating a solution item under the clustered data item in the 
project tree.
</p>

<p>
gCLUTO will also automatically open a <b>Solution View</b> similar to (b) 
in Figure 3.1.  This view contains the options used for clustering and several
statistics about the clusters.  The report is designed after the report given by
CLUTO.  For further explanation of its meaning see CLUTO's documentation.  In
addition, the report contains links, similar to a web page.  Clicking on these
links allows for quick navigation between related information in large reports.
</p>

<p>
gCLUTO has been designed to facilitate clustering of the same data multiple
times.  If a previously clustered data item is chosen for clustering again, the 
Clustering Options dialog will appear with the options that were used the
previous time.  To reload the options used for creating a particular solution, 
right-click the desired solution item in the project tree and choose "Recluster" 
from the pop-up menu.  This will bring up the Clustering Options dialog with 
the solution's options loaded.  This feature eases the process of repeated 
adjustments to clustering options.
</p>


<a name="3.4.1"><h2>3.4.1 Comparing Solutions</h2></a>


<div width="320" style="float: right; padding: 5px" align="center">
<a href="images/screenshot-data.gif"><img alt="screen shot"
   src="images/screenshot-data.gif" width="320"><br>
   Figure 3.2 - screen shot of the Data View</a>
<br><br>
</div>

<p>
The Data View can be used to compare multiple solutions for a single
data item.  When solutions exist, a second spread sheet, called the
<b>Solution Grid</b>, will appear on the right hand side of the view.
Each column of the Solution Grid belongs to a different solution and is
labeled after the solution's label shown in the project tree.  The
integers appearing in the Solution Grid signify to which cluster each
row of the data matrix was partitioned.
</p>

<p>
The Solution Grid and the <b>Data Grid</b> to its left are designed to
work together. Thus, scrolling vertically in either grid will cause the
other to also scroll.  Row resizing is also synced between the two
grids.  Horizontal scrolling is done independently in order to allow
comparisons to be made between any column in the Data Grid and any
column in the Solution Grid.
</p>

<p>
Clicking on any column label in the Data View will sort the rows of the
Data Grid and Solution Grid based on the values of the column.  Clicking
on the same column twice will reverse the direction of the sort.
Therefore, if a column label in the Solution Grid is clicked, rows of the same
cluster will be displayed together.  This allows quick comparisons of
the partitioning of different solutions.  Sorting can be reset by
choosing the "Reset Sorting" option in the "Data" menu.  Columns in the
Data Grid cannot be sorted when the grid is in <b>sparse matrix</b>
view.
</p>


<a name="3.5"><h2>3.5 Visualizing Solutions</h2></a>

<p>
Currently, gCLUTO contains two visualizations: the <b>Matrix Visualization</b> 
and the <b>Mountain Visualization</b>.  Visualizations can be generated from
solutions by choosing the desired visualization from the solution menu.  This
menu can be found by right-clicking on a solution item in the project tree or in
the menu bar under "Solution" if the user is currently working in a Solution
View.
</p>

<a name="3.5.1"><h2>3.5.1 Matrix Visualization</h2></a>

<p>
The Matrix Visualization is similar to the matrix visualization produced by 
CLUTO. The former extends the latter by making the matrix interactive.  A 
detailed explanation of the visualization is given in CLUTO's documentation.  
</p>

<p>
In the Matrix Visualization, the orginal data matrix is displayed such that
colors are used to graphically represent the values present in the matrix. 
gCLUTO uses white to represent values near zero, increaingly darker shades of 
red to represent large values, and increasingly darker shades of green to
represent negitive values.  The rows of the matrix are reorder, such that rows
of the same cluster are together.  Black horizontal dividers separate the
clusters.
</p>

<div width="320" style="float: right; padding: 5px" align="center">
<a href="images/screenshot-matrix.jpg"><img alt="screen shot"
   src="images/screenshot-matrix.jpg" width="320"><br>
   Figure 3.3 - screen shot of the Matrix Visualization</a>
<br><br>
</div>

<p>
If tree building is enabled, the Matrix Visualization will contain trees located
above and to the left of the matrix.  If an agglomerative clustering algorithm 
was used, the tree generated during clustering is displayed as the <b>Row Tree</b>.  
Otherwise, a tree is generated to fit the clustering solution.  
The <b>Column Tree</b> is generated by performing
agglomerative clustering on the inverse of the matrix.
</p>

<p>
If row and column labels were chosen when the data was imported, then they will
appear below and to the right of the matrix. Labels will only show if space is 
available to display them.
</p>

<p>
To help explore the information contained within the Matrix Visualization, 
several features have been implemented.  First, the size of the matrix can be 
scaled in multiple ways.  Second, the trees can be used to collapse and expand 
areas of interest within the matrix.  Lastly, the user can access information
about any cell by clicking the right mouse button on cells.  A popup dialog
box will appear giving the row and column labels and ids as well as the value
and cluster id associated with the cell.
</p>

<h3>3.5.1 Matrix Visualization - Scaling</h3>

<p>
The easiest way to scale the matrix is with the scaling controls located
directly above the matrix.  Scaling can be changed by entering a new size in the
text box, or by clicking on either of the up or down arrows.  The control
labeled with "W" controls the width of the matrix and the control labeled "H"
affects the height.  These scaling controls change the dimensions of the entire
matrix and are convenient for zooming in and out of areas of interest in the
matrix.
</p>

<p>
Often times the user needs to enlarge one area of the matrix, yet shrink
areas that are not as important.  This type of scaling can also be done.  To
resize only a portion of the matrix, start by selecting the area to be resized. 
Selection is done by clicking on any cell and draging the mouse to another cell.
These two cells will become the corners of the selected region.  Cells that are
selected are shaded blue.  To resize the selected region, place the mouse over
any edge of the region.  The cursor will change to a resizing cursor.  Click and
drag the edge to the desired location.  The selected cells will then resize 
to fit within the new region.
</p>

<p>
The following options are available under the "Matrix" menu:
<ul>
   <li><b>Reset Sizing</b> - Restores all scaling to the default values
   <li><b>Fit to Screen</b> - Resizes the matrix to fit within the visualization
                              window
</ul>
The following options are available under the "Matrix" menu only when the row 
tree has been generated:
<ul>
   <li><b>View All Objects</b> - Expand all nodes in the row tree so that every
                                 object is visible
   <li><b>View Only Clusters</b> - Collapse nodes in the row tree so that only 
                                   cluster averages are displayed
</ul>
</p>

<h3>3.5.1 Matrix Visualization - Using the Trees</h3>

<p>
The Row and Column Trees allow for collapsing and expanding of the matrix.  
Blue squares in the tree represent nodes that are fully expanded.  Clicking on
any expanded node will collapse it.  Collapsed nodes are represented as pink
squares.  When a node is collapsed, all of its descendents are hidden.  If a 
node in the Row Tree is collapsed, all of the rows of the collapsed region are 
hidden and replaced with a single row that contains their average.  Simply click
a collapsed node to expand it again.  The Column Tree works in a similar manner.
</p>

<p>
The labels will change to describe the collapsed regions.  If a region contains 
rows which all belong to the same cluster, then it will be labeled with the
cluster id.  If multiple clusters are present in a collapsed region then it will
be labeled "multi-cluster".
</p>




<a name="3.5.2"><h2>3.5.2 Mountain Visualization</h2></a>

<div width="320" style="float: right; padding: 5px" align="center">
<a href="images/screenshot-mtn.jpg"><img alt="screen shot"
   src="images/screenshot-mtn.jpg" width="320"><br>
   Figure 3.4 - screen shot of the Mountain Visualization</a>
<br><br>
</div>

<p>
The <b>Mountain Visualization</b> is used to visualize the relative similarity
of clusters as well as their size, internal similarity, and internal deviation.
In the mountain visualization, each cluster is represented as a peak in the 3D 
terrain.  A peak's location, volume, height, and color are all used to protray
information about the associated cluster.
</p>

<p>
The user can navigate through and around the 3D visualization by clicking and
dragging the mouse over the 3D display.  Different mouse buttons perform
different actions.
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Left Click</b> - Rotates the terrain.
   <li><b>Right Click</b> - Moves the terrain up, down, left, and right.
   <li><b>Middle Click</b> - Zooms in and out.
</ul>

<p>
The location of the peaks in the plane is determined using <b>Multidimensional 
Scaling</b> (MDS) on each of the cluster mid-points.  MDS
attempts to preserve the distances between vertices as they are mapped from a
high dimensional space down to a lower dimensional space.  In this application,
cluster mid-points are used as vertices in MDS and are mapped to a two
dimensional plane.
</p>

<p>
MDS allows users to make inferences about their data using the 
Mountain Visualization.  For example, in Figure 3.4 a data matrix was clustered
into ten clusters.  The Moutain Visualization represents these ten clusters as
ten peaks labeled by their cluster id.  Although ten clusters were
requested, MDS has placed the peaks in two distinct groups.  We can infer that 
clusters within each group are strongly similar, while widely different from
clusters in the other group.  Thus, the visualization suggests the data would 
better lend itself to a two-way clustering.
</p>

<div width="320" style="float: right; padding: 5px" align="center">
<a href="images/figure-mtn.gif">
<img alt="screen shot"
   src="images/figure-mtn.gif" width="320" height="200"><br>
   Figure 3.5 - How peak heights add</a>
<br><br>
</div>

<p>
The shape of each peak is a Gaussian curve.  This shape is used as a rough
estimate of the distribution of the data within each cluster.  The height of 
each peak is portional to the cluster's internal similarity.  The volume of a
peak is portional to the number of elements contained within the cluster.  The
resulting Gaussian curves are added togther to form the terrain of the Mountain
Visualization.
</p>

<p>
<i>Note: When comparing peak heights keep in mind that the Mountain Visualization
has added the peak curves together.  As seen in Figure 3.5, the resultant height
is taller than the true height.</i>
</p>

<p>
The color of a peak is proportional to the cluster's internal deviation.  Red
indicates low deviation where as blue indicates high deviation.  Only the color
at the tip of a peak is significant.  At all other areas, the color is
determined by blending to create a smooth transition.
</p>

<p>
Clicking on any label will load statistics about the associated cluster into the
text window located below the visualization.  This information is identical to 
the information found in the Solution Report.  If column labels have been chosen 
for this data, then the Mountain Visualization can display the most common 
features above each peak.  This option is called "Show Features" and is found 
in the "Mountain" menu.
</p>





<a name="3.6"><h2>3.6 Printing</h2></a>

<p>
Printing is performed in gCLUTO by first opening a View to print.  Once a View
is opened, printing and previewing can be initiated under the "File" menu. 
Printing is only available for the following Views:
</p>

<ul>
   <li>Matrix Visualization View
   <li>Mountain Visualization View
</ul>

<p>
Additional printing options such as page margins, page dimensions, and printer
settings can be found by choosing the "Page Setup" and "Print Setup" options
under the "File" menu.  Views can also be printed to Post Script files by
selecting the "Print to File" option in the Print Dialog.
</p>

<a name="3.6.1"><h2>3.6.1 Printing Details</h2></a>

<p>
The various dimensions of the visualizations printed are calculated by the
dimensions of the <b>Printable Area</b>.  The Printable Area is the area of the
page that is within the margins.  Choosing a smaller printable area will
generate smaller graphics.
</p>

<p>
When printing the Matrix Visualization, the matrix is scaled to fit the entire
page.  Relative scaling of rows and columns is left intact.  If labels or
trees are present, they are each allocated roughly one sixth of the width of 
the Printable Area.
</p>

<p>
Mountain Visualizations are printed using the perspective and dimensions of the
current Mountain Visualization View.  The visualization is scaled to fill as
much of the Printable Area as possible without exceeding the margins.
</p>




<a name="3.7"><h2>3.7 Exporting</h2></a>

<p>
Exporting is performed in gCLUTO by first opening a View to export.  Once a
View is opened, exporting can be initiated by choosing the "Export" option
under the "Project" menu.  The following Views can be exported:

<ul>
   <li>Data View
   <li>Solution View (Solution Report)
</ul>

<p>
Data Views are exported as tab delimited files containing the data matrix as
well any solution columns that are present.  Row and column labels are also
included in the first column and row, respectively.  If labels are not given,
then default labels "rowX" and "colX" are used, where "X" is replaced by the
row or column number.  Tab delimited files can be opened by most spread sheet
programs.
</p>

<p>
Solution Views are exported as HTML files.  The HTML files will contain the
same information that is present in the Solution Report.  This makes it easier
to use and share the information given in Solution Reports.  Web
browsers and most word processors can open HTML files.
